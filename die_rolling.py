Description:

    Hello! Today your task is to build a basic die feature, where you will get a range in the form (min, max) - both included - and return a random number in the inclusive range.

    Props if you don't use your language's random library!

    dice(2, 7) # returns a value that can be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
